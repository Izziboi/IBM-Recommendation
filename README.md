# IBM-Recommendation
## Introduction<br>
This project aims to make recommendations to IBM Watson Studio platform users. Users of this platform have user ids and there are thousands of articles to access. Each article has an article id and a name. Users access articles as much as they want. As they access the articles, the plaform keeps track of the number of interactions. All these information are contained in the datasets used for this project. The essence of this work is to recommend articles for users based on certain conditions such as the articles their statistical neighbors have interacted with. Neighbors in this context, are users who have accessed some of the articles a particular user has accessed. There are also other conditions implemented in the analyses as can be seen in the codes of the work. The codes have docstrings that explain what each function does and can be understood by a non programmer.<br>
